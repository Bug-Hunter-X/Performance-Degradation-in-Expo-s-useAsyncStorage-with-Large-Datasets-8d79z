This bug occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook with a large amount of data.  The issue is that the hook's internal state management isn't optimized for large datasets, leading to performance degradation and potential crashes.  This is particularly noticeable on lower-end devices or when handling complex data structures. The error might manifest as slow loading times, app freezes, or even unexpected crashes.  No specific error message is consistently reported, making it difficult to debug solely through error logs.
